    <!-- 
    Note: This page demonstrates the use of a download link.
    The download attribute is used to specify that the target will be downloaded
    when a user clicks on the hyperlink. This is useful for downloadable content
    like PDFs, images, or other documents.
    
    Make sure to actually create a 'documents' folder and place a 'brochure.pdf' 
    file in it for this link to work properly.
